This repository is part of my Data Analytics Learning Journey.
It was developed under trainer guidance to understand how to transform raw data into actionable business insights using Power BI.
The focus is on analyzing Food Meal Sales data to create an interactive dashboard that helps visualize sales trends, top-performing items, and customer purchase patterns.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains details about food meal transactions such as:
Order Date & Time
Item Name & Category
Quantity Sold
Unit Price
Total Sales Amount
Data was already clean — minimal modifications were made for analysis (e.g., adding calculated columns).

Tools & Skills Used
Power BI – Dashboard design, DAX measures, data modeling
Data Transformation – Creating calculated columns, date & time extraction
Data Visualization – Using charts, slicers, and KPIs for interactive exploration

Dashboard Features
The Power BI Dashboard includes:
KPI Cards – Total Sales, Total Quantity Sold, Average Order Value
Top Selling Meals – Bar chart of best-performing items
Slicers/Filters – Filter by date, category, or specific menu item

Learning Outcomes
From this project, I learned how to:
Load and transform data in Power BI
Create calculated columns & measures using DAX
Design an interactive and visually appealing dashboard
Use slicers and filters for dynamic analysis
